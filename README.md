## Ethical Considerations

This project is intended for **research and educational purposes only**. It should not be used as a replacement for professional medical diagnosis. Key considerations:

- Model predictions should always be validated by qualified healthcare professionals
- Patient data privacy and confidentiality must be maintained
- Potential biases in training data should be acknowledged
- Regulatory compliance (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR) is essential for clinical deployment

## Future Enhancements

- Multi-class classification (COVID-19, tuberculosis, etc.)
- Integration with DICOM medical imaging standards
- Model deployment on cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Mobile application for point-of-care use
- Integration with hospital information systems
