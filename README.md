- Model predictions should always be validated by qualified healthcare professionals
- Patient data privacy and confidentiality must be maintained
- Potential biases in training data should be acknowledged
- Regulatory compliance (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR) is essential for clinical deployment

## Future Enhancements
